```bash
# in order to use pyxenon, you could do the following

# let's make a new project
mkdir ~/mypyxenonproj
cd ~/mypyxenonproj

# let's start a new virtual environment based on Python 3.5
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 .venv35
source ./.venv35/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip

# make a directory to keep the dependencies in:
mkdir libs
cd libs/

# get the pyxenon source code
git clone https://github.com/NLeSC/pyxenon.git
cd pyxenon

# install the pyxenon package into the virtual environment
pip install --upgrade .[test]

# see if everything works,like it should
pytest tests/

# back to the project directory
cd ~/mypyxenonproj

# then start developing your pyxenon project using the same virtualenv
# once pyxenon has been updated on PyPI, you should be able to simply do a ``pip install --upgrade pyxenon`` 
```

Note on generating the Sphinx documentation:

The ``*.py.rst`` files are generated by running the restructured text wrapper:

```
cd xenon-rse2017-tutorial/source/python
python3.5 restructedtext_wrapper.py `find ./examples | grep .py$`
```
