# local,sftp,slurm,ssh,torque,webdav}
# not sure what ot do yet, let's keep it simple and ask for help on (local) 
# file manipulation
# FIXME add longer --help alternative to existing -h option for 'xenon file' 
# command (functionality seems to exist, but not included in usage line)

# --location option says both c: and <drive letter>:, maybe change to just 
# <windows drive letter>:  . Also, what about lowercase/uppercase?

# 'xenon file' usage line seems to suggest that I need to pick one from {copy,
# list,remove}. simplest one is probably 'list', so:
xenon file list --help
# so I need a 'path' as final argument
# TODO add examples of valid paths
# FIXME 'path of location' what does that mean (update: location refers to the
# --location LOCATION you get when doing 'xenon file --help')
# FIXME ls -1 gives 14 lines of results, xenon 15 for the same dir. It looks
# like xenon-cli adds an empty line
# valid syntax, absolute paths

# now we let's see if we can use schedulers, starting with slurm
# first need to bring up a 'remote' slurm
# we'll use a slurm docker container called nlesc/xenon-slurm from dockerhub
docker run --detach --publish 10022:22 nlesc/xenon-slurm:17

# use docker ps to check the state of the container
docker ps
# once the status is healthy, see if we can ssh into it as user 'xenon' with password 'javagat'
xenon -p 10022 xenon@localhost
# if that works, exit again

# let's see what help is available for slurm
xenon slurm --help

# let's first ask what queues the slurm scheduler has. need to specify location, otherwise we don't 
# know who to ask. location is any location supported by ssh or local scheduler.
xenon slurm --location ssh://xenon@localhost queues # errors, invalid location string format I think
xenon slurm --location ssh://localhost queues       # also errors
xenon slurm --location localhost queues             # error because it tries to connect to default port 22 (should be 10022)
# check the xenon ssh --help help to find out the valid syntax for location
xenon ssh --help
xenon slurm --location localhost:10022 queues       # immediately returns authentication timeout error (a bit confusing, it's not a timeout issue I think FIXME)
# we need to also provide credentials, check the top level xenon help
xenon --help
# so --username and --password
xenon --username xenon --password javagat slurm --location localhost:10022 queues   # winning!
